This library works with **WordPress** plug-ins made by **Piggly** company. It creates form inputs and has a solid and unique CSS style. The CSS will work well in the WordPress Admin area because it wraps elements to a master class `.pgly-wps-settings`. However, you are free to use it for other purposes.

>  For now, we do not provide any documentation, but a fast looking to each code will help you to use it.
